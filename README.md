# Adding file upload to a website

In this section we go through what setup we need to do in client side, backend side and on database end to successfully provide a feature of file uploads to a site.

## Two sides of file uploads

- Client side
  - User should be able to select and preview a file
  - Submit form should include file + other data

- Server side
  - Incoming file should be extracted (just like other data)
  - File should be stored + possibly served as well
